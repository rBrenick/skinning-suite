# skinning-suite
Blender addon for weight paint workflows.

These are some simple operators to deal with vertex selections, and other things that I normally use when painting weights.

**NOTE: Has not been properly tested in production. Almost definitely has issues lurking within.**

Was mostly a way for me to get my feet wet when it comes to creating handy blender tools.

Thanks to [Daniel Bystedt](https://twitter.com/3dbystedt) for giving me a bunch of examples of manipulating mesh data. Was absolutely invaluable when getting comfortable with Blender.
